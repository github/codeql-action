  cleanup-level:
    description: "Level of cleanup to perform on CodeQL databases at the end of the analyze step. This should either be 'none' to skip cleanup, or be a valid argument for the --mode flag of the CodeQL CLI command 'codeql database cleanup' as documented at https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/manual/database-cleanup"
    required: false
    default: "brutal"
  ram:
    description: >-
      The amount of memory in MB that can be used by CodeQL for database finalization and query execution.
      By default, this action will use the same amount of memory as previously set in the "init" action.
      If the "init" action also does not have an explicit "ram" input, this action will use most of the
      memory available in the system (which for GitHub-hosted runners is 6GB for Linux, 5.5GB for Windows,
      and 13GB for macOS).

    description: Specify whether or not to add code snippets to the output sarif file.
    required: false
    default: "false"
  skip-queries:
    description: If this option is set, the CodeQL database will be built but no queries will be run on it. Thus, no results will be produced.
    required: false
    default: "false"
  threads:
    description: >-
      The number of threads that can be used by CodeQL for database finalization and query execution.
      By default, this action will use the same number of threads as previously set in the "init" action.
      If the "init" action also does not have an explicit "threads" input, this action will use all the
      hardware threads available in the system (which for GitHub-hosted runners is 2 for Linux and Windows
      and 3 for macOS).

  sha:
    description: "The sha of the HEAD of the ref where results will be uploaded. If not provided, the Action will use the GITHUB_SHA environment variable. If provided, the ref input must be provided as well. This input is not available in pull requests from forks."
