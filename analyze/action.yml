inputs:
  check_name:
    description: The name of the check run to add text to.
    required: false
  output:
    description: The path of the directory in which to save the SARIF results
    required: false
    default: "../results"
  upload:
    description: >-
      Upload the SARIF file to Code Scanning.
      Defaults to 'always' which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.
      'failure-only' only uploads debugging information to Code Scanning if the workflow run fails, for users post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning.
      'never' avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning, even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.
    required: false
    # If changing this, make sure to update workflow.ts accordingly.
    default: "always"
  cleanup-level:
    description: "Level of cleanup to perform on CodeQL databases at the end of the analyze step. This should either be 'none' to skip cleanup, or be a valid argument for the --cache-cleanup flag of the CodeQL CLI command 'codeql database cleanup' as documented at https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/manual/database-cleanup"
    required: false
    default: "brutal"
  ram:
    description: >-
      The amount of memory in MB that can be used by CodeQL for database finalization and query execution.
      By default, this action will use the same amount of memory as previously set in the "init" action.
      If the "init" action also does not have an explicit "ram" input, this action will use most of the
      memory available in the system (which for GitHub-hosted runners is 6GB for Linux, 5.5GB for Windows,
      and 13GB for macOS).
    required: false
  add-snippets:
    description: Specify whether or not to add code snippets to the output sarif file.
    required: false
    default: "false"
    deprecationMessage: >-
      The input "add-snippets" is deprecated and will be removed on the first release in August 2025.
      When this input is set to true it is expected to add code snippets with an alert to the SARIF file.
      However, since Code Scanning ignores code snippets provided as part of a SARIF file this is currently
      a no operation. No alternative is available.
  skip-queries:
    description: If this option is set, the CodeQL database will be built but no queries will be run on it. Thus, no results will be produced.
    required: false
    default: "false"
  threads:
    description: >-
      The number of threads that can be used by CodeQL for database finalization and query execution.
      By default, this action will use the same number of threads as previously set in the "init" action.
      If the "init" action also does not have an explicit "threads" input, this action will use all the
      hardware threads available in the system (which for GitHub-hosted runners is 2 for Linux and Windows
      and 3 for macOS).
    required: false
  checkout_path:
    description: "The path at which the analyzed repository was checked out. Used to relativize any absolute paths in the uploaded SARIF file."
    required: false
    # If changing this, make sure to update workflow.ts accordingly.
    default: ${{ github.workspace }}
  ref:
    description: "The ref where results will be uploaded. If not provided, the Action will use the GITHUB_REF environment variable. If provided, the sha input must be provided as well. This input is ignored for pull requests from forks."
    required: false
  sha:
    description: "The sha of the HEAD of the ref where results will be uploaded. If not provided, the Action will use the GITHUB_SHA environment variable. If provided, the ref input must be provided as well. This input is ignored for pull requests from forks."
    required: false

    required: true
    default: "true"
  token:
    description: "GitHub token to use for authenticating with this instance of GitHub. The token must be the built-in GitHub Actions token, and the workflow must have the `security-events: write` permission. Most of the time it is advisable to avoid specifying this input so that the workflow falls back to using the default value."
