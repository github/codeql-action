     *
     *  .byPage() returns an async iterable iterator to list of page ranges that differ between a specified snapshot and this page blob.
     *
     * Example using `for await` syntax:
     *
     * ```js
     * // Get the pageBlobClient before you run these snippets,
     * // Can be obtained from `blobServiceClient.getContainerClient("<your-container-name>").getPageBlobClient("<your-blob-name>");`
     * let i = 1;
     * for await (const pageRange of pageBlobClient.listPageRangesDiff()) {
     *   console.log(`Page range ${i++}: ${pageRange.start} - ${pageRange.end}`);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Example using `iter.next()`:
     *
     * ```js
     * let i = 1;
     * let iter = pageBlobClient.listPageRangesDiff();
     * let pageRangeItem = await iter.next();
     * while (!pageRangeItem.done) {
     *   console.log(`Page range ${i++}: ${pageRangeItem.value.start} - ${pageRangeItem.value.end}, IsClear: ${pageRangeItem.value.isClear}`);
     *   pageRangeItem = await iter.next();
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Example using `byPage()`:
     *
     * ```js
     * // passing optional maxPageSize in the page settings
     * let i = 1;
     * for await (const response of pageBlobClient.listPageRangesDiff().byPage({ maxPageSize: 20 })) {
     *   for (const pageRange of response) {
     *     console.log(`Page range ${i++}: ${pageRange.start} - ${pageRange.end}`);
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Example using paging with a marker:
     *
     * ```js
     * let i = 1;
     * let iterator = pageBlobClient.listPageRangesDiff().byPage({ maxPageSize: 2 });
     * let response = (await iterator.next()).value;
     *

     * // Passing next marker as continuationToken
     *
     * iterator = pageBlobClient.listPageRangesDiff().byPage({ continuationToken: marker, maxPageSize: 10 });
     * response = (await iterator.next()).value;
     *
